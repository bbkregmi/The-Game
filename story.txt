The Story

Our story takes place at a fantasy setting at some small planet. The planet is inhabited by humans, who have formed their own nations, and for the most part, live peacefully amongst each other. The planet is also inhabited by mutants, mindless beasts that attack any life form other than themselves. Our MC is a soldier of one of the nation's army, deployed on a campaign to clear some area of mutants for the expansion of his nation (Tutorial). <i>We can add some story here on how MC meets other soldiers for his party. </i>MC and team then get selected to be the first to explore a distant planet, make note of any natives, and bring back samples of the planet's resources.

MC and team get deployed to the distant planet. Upon arrival, MC and co. are immediately attacked by mutants, same as on their home planet. MC explores the new planet, traveling long distances through a vehicle stored inside their spaceship, encountering more mutants.<i> MC can also encounter humans who were left behind, and have survived to this date</i>. MC learns that humans are originially from this planet, and that the mutants are radioactive mutations of humans themselved. MC conveys this information back to his own planet. The story ends with humans re-colonizing their planet by planting a small tree.
